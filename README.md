## Using Wireshark to Analyze Vulnerabilities

To complete your network analysis and detect vulnerabilities, you can use **Wireshark**, a powerful packet analysis tool.

### Installing Wireshark

- Download Wireshark from the official website: [Wireshark Download](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html).

### Using Wireshark

4. **Launch Wireshark** and select the network interface to monitor (e.g. Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
**Start capturing** network traffic.
**Analyze traffic** to detect suspicious or malicious packets.
To follow a specific TCP stream, right-click on the packet and select "Follow" > "TCP Stream".
You can also export the captured data for further analysis.

## Warning

Using this script to perform DDoS attacks without authorization is illegal and unethical. Use it only in a controlled environment and with proper authorization.
